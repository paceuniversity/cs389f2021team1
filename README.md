**App Description:** Our app aims to hold companies responsible and ensure people have a transparent view of how they operate. Users can anonymously rate companies based on various metrics (like environmental sustainability and working conditions) and give a brief synopsis of their experience with them. Then users can look at average ratings and reviews to gain insight into the culture of a company and decide if it's one they wish to work with or support.
