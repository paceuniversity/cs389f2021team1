        \nMission Statement:  \n \nOur app aims to hold companies responsible and ensure people
        have a transparent view of how they operate. Users can anonymously rate companies
        based on various metrics (like environmental sustainability and working conditions)
        and give a brief synopsis of their experience with them. Then users can look at
        average ratings and reviews to gain insight into the culture of a company and decide
        if it\'s one they wish to work with or support.</string>
